===========

eclipse/ has the examples in eclipse project format, no longer updated.  Otherwise the examples are for android studio.

<b>Speak2Text</b>, <b>speach2Textdemo2</b>, and <b>speach2textDemo</b> show the varying ways to do speech to text

<b>txt2spk</b> is a simple example to do text to speach.

<b>VoiceActionsDemo</b>  Show how to add voice Actions to your app.  This example use the create_note intent.

<b>VoiceInteractions</b> is an attempt at VoiceInteractions which only sort of work.  run it and say Take a selfie 
and it will show the pickoptions.  The search music intent doesn't work as documented (nor most of the intents allow voice interactions) on a Nexus 5X with marshmallow 6.0.1   As note, the app_name is tuneIn to test "Play music on TuneIn" which doesn't really work.
