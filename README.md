Android speech Examples
===========

`eclipse/` has the examples in eclipse project format, no longer updated.  Otherwise the examples are for android studio.

`legacy/` is older examples that are either depreciated or have been replaced by newer ones.

`speech2text` use the button to have it recognize the speech.  It will list the top 5 results and speak the top result.  It also has multilingual abilities.  

`speech2textdemo` use the recognizerIntent to get the speech2text engine and displays the top 5 results.  

`speech2textdemo2` builds it's own interface, instead of using the recognizerIntent.  still displays the top 5 results.

`text2speech` is a simple example to do text to speech.   works in API 30 with queries additions.
