Android speech Examples LEGACY
===========

these are no longer updated and are considered legacy examples.  they will like stop working in API 31+

<b>VoiceActionsDemo</b>  Show how to add voice Actions to your app.  This example uses the create_note intent.

<b>VoiceInteractions</b> is an attempt at VoiceInteractions.  Most of the intents don't support voice, but the camera intent does.  So say Take a selfie  OR take a picture.  Take a selfie conforms use of the front camera, while take a picture will ask which camera to use.  A Note, no picture is actually taken by the app.   This example is be considered as legacy, since android is basically abandoned the voice interactions for Google assistant methods.  When I get a change, I'll replace this example with the "new way" and move this to a legacy directory.


These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course.
